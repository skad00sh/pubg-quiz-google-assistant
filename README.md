Privacy Policy for PUBG Quiz on the Google Assistant

The content for PUBG Quiz has been developed by Skad00sh. However, PUBG Quiz runs on systems provided by Google, and Skad00sh does not have full access to the app. In particular, Skad00sh has no ability to access the messages you send to PUBG Quiz or the responses that it sends back to you.

Skad00sh may receive from Google non-personally identifying information about the use of PUBG Quiz. For instance, Skad00sh can access usage information regarding how many users are using the app, which geographical regions they are located in, and basic data including users’ language, device type, and length and frequency of use. None of the information Skad00sh receives from Google identifies you, nor does it reveal to Skad00sh what information you sent to the app or what specific responses the app sent to you.

When you use PUBG Quiz, you are also using the Google Assistant, and the Google Privacy Policy describes how Google collects and uses data about your use of the app. You may wish to consult Google’s documentation regarding what information is shared with your Google Assistant and how to delete your Google Assistant activity.

Skad00sh may, in the future, modify PUBG Quiz to run on infrastructure which Skad00sh has full access to, which would allow Skad00sh access to additional information about your interaction with the app. Should that occur, Skad00sh will comply with its obligations under applicable privacy law, including updating this Privacy Policy as required.
